Though Hugo has been on my radar for many years I never thought about implementing it. Firstly, despite the incessant internal chatter, I don't write much of it down and certainly not in publically available spaces. That being said, I'm sure I had written some kind of blog as a youth and hopefully this one may be of further use. 

Ngl, Hugo was not as easy as I thought it would be at first. This was mainly due to my limited knoweldge of the Go language. However, for the case of Hugo, there isn't much to learn and since I found an excellent but basic theme, I can see many ways to further customize the blog using already existing knowledge of Tailwind CSS. Exciting stuff for me. 

The real question with something like Hugo is why choose it over something like Wordpress or something more 'impressive' such as having your blog entries stored in a database and then accessed via some API. 

The real answer is that I like the idea of portability and simplicity too much. The idea of carrying the entire site on something like a floppy disk and then being able to deploy it onto a server with the correct SSH key and an rsync command is just amazingly satisfying to think about. 

With the addition of using a flake.nix file for the environment, even just launching it locally and perusing the blog is easy to do all local (after the appropriate packages are downloaded of course). 

I'll leave it at that for now but overall I am satisfied with what I can imagine is possible with something like Hugo. I also hear it's a fast framework but I've not tested it. 

It has my preliminary recommendation for sure!
